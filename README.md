# Reflection
1. Challenges: I've found Overdue mark to be the hardest to implement. I confused conditions many times and it was a little bit tricky to take into account the change event on the status field. I also haven't really done any proper styling, there was just a lot to do (and I had to work too). I've also found that before I had the condition to check for empty input fields, they were clearing automatically after adding the task. However, with conditions, I had to manually clear them.
2. I had to use a lot of console.log and dev tools and even that sometimes would be hard to figure out. I think it's important for us to also learn and practice where to put those console.log's when debugging - it's not always easy to figure out. But overall, I've done this after SBA 5 from scratch and it felt easier than my first version - but then I made a whole mess there after attempting to add a method to an object - that wasn't really working out. What I liked is that I think I've employed more separate functions that I could call inside the event listeners - that's supposed to make the code more readable, I think.
3. I would add styling for sure. I'd like a delete button, i could've probably done it. I'd also like to allow editing the deadline date - but I currently struggle with the concept of editing.
